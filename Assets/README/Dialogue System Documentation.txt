How to Set Up
Import the asset into your Unity project.

Create a Story asset by right-clicking in your Project window → Create → Dialogue → Story.

In the Story asset, fill in the basic information:

Player Name

NPC Name

Choose Dialogue Type: Linear or Branching

Assign the Story asset to the DialogueManager in the scene.

Add your dialogue UI panel and link it to the manager (UI Texts, Buttons, etc.).

1.Linear Dialogue: How to Fill It
Create elements in the Phrases and Responses arrays.

If your dialogue includes player responses, make sure to check the Have Responses box.

Fill the arrays in strict matching order. Each phrase should correspond to a response in the same index.

Example:
Phrases:

"Hi, my name is Bill. What's yours?"

"What are you doing here?"

Responses:

"My name is Harry."

"Just passing through."

Keep the order consistent. If the arrays are not synchronized correctly, the dialogue will not display as intended.

2.Branching Dialogue: How to Fill It
Each branching dialogue consists of elements. Every element contains:

Questions – Player's choices.

NPC Responses – What NPC says for each question.

Next Step Indices – Where the dialogue goes after that response.

Step-by-step:
Add a new element to the Branching Elements array.

Fill out the three arrays for that element:

Questions – Write what the player can say.

NPC Responses – Write how the NPC will respond to each.

Next Step Indices – Define what happens next:

-1 = end dialogue

0 = return to first element

1, 2, etc. = go to another branching element index

Example:
Element 0

Questions:

"Hi, what's your name?"

"What do you do here?"

NPC Responses:

"Hello, my name is Bill."

"I'm the local merchant."

Next Step Indices:

0 – return to same questions

-1 – end the dialogue

Make sure all three arrays have the same number of entries and that each entry corresponds to the correct one in the other arrays.
